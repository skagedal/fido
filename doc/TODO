TODO: 

 - GrssFeedsStore documentation should list the overrides

Questions:

 - [libgrss] What's the idea - how to add a feed to a feedsstore?  It
   seems you can only add items?

 - [vala] Should I use override? ("public override bool has_item (...)")

g-ir-scan:

 - better error reporting:
   - when command returned non-zero, don't display Python list of command
   - when --introspect didn't write file, say that, no stack trace
